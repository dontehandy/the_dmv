#think data

#instance variables are used to store data that is specific to an object.
#hash is a collection of key-value pairs
#hash = {key => value} or {key: value}
#to get the value of a key in a hash, you can use hash[:key]. 
#using it in the class 
#this is an example of a nested hash because the hash is inside the class

#0824 - need to define the vehicle and registrant classes with the methods and attributes that are being called in the facility class
